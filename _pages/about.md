<“The explanation requiring the fewest assumptions is most likely to be correct.”>
< --- William of Ockham> 


I am a DPhil student in the Kennedy institute at the University of Oxford under the supervision of Dr. Ngee Han Lim and Dr. Bartlomiej Papiez. Before that I obtained a MRes degree in the Hamlyn Center for Robotic Surgery at the Imperial College London under the supervision of Prof. Guang-Zhong Yang, and a BEng degree in Department of Electrical Engineering & Electronics at the University of Liverpool.

My ultimate goal is to conquer biomedical problems and to improve healthcare level via developing advanced techniques. My current research interest is in biomedical image analysis and medical computer vision with an emphasis on the computational models and applications of machine learning based approaches.
